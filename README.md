# üß∞ Multi-DBMS Infrastructure Lab

This repository simulates the backend infrastructure of a fictional **Enterprise Inventory & Asset Management System**. The system is designed to manage a mid-sized enterprise‚Äôs hardware and software assets, tracking their lifecycle, inventory logs, vendor relations, and audit history.

The project demonstrates the integration and management of **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, and **MongoDB**, along with automation, security, backup strategies, and disaster recovery solutions. It aims to simulate the technical challenges and solutions typically faced by a **Database Administrator (DBA)** in a multi-database, enterprise-level environment.

üéØ **Goal**: To showcase comprehensive **system administration** and **DBA** skills through a fully automated and secure infrastructure, complete with backup/recovery, performance tuning, and disaster recovery.

### Architecture

In this section, you'll briefly describe the architecture and how the components work together. I suggest adding a diagram here, but let's first focus on the content.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The infrastructure is built using **Ubuntu 22.04** VMs, managed by **Ansible**. The backend consists of multiple DBMS:
- **PostgreSQL**: For managing structured business data.
- **MySQL**: For handling additional relational data.
- **MongoDB**: For NoSQL data storage with flexible schema designs.

The setup includes:
- **SSH Access**: Secure access to all VMs using SSH keys.
- **Ansible Automation**: For provisioning, updates, and configuration of DBMS.
- **Firewall**: Enforced via UFW to restrict access to necessary ports.
- **Backup & Recovery**: Scheduled with cron jobs and stored in secure locations.
- **Performance Tuning**: Indexing and query optimization in PostgreSQL and MySQL.
- **Security**: RBAC applied to each DBMS for strict user management.

### Features & Functionality

This section will describe the main features and what‚Äôs implemented, followed by the `Backup & Recovery` and `Security & Access Control` sections.

## üéØ Features & Functionality

- **DBMS Setup**: Automated deployment of PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB.
- **Schema Creation**: Enterprise-level schemas for Inventory and Asset Management.
- **User Management**: Role-based access control (RBAC) with secure user setups.
- **Backup & Recovery**: Automated backup scripts using cron and secure storage.
- **Performance Tuning**: Indexing, slow query log analysis, and query optimization.
- **Security Hardening**: Disable root, enforce SSH key-based authentication, and firewall rules.

### üîí Security & Access Control

- Role-based access (admin, read-only, app users)
- Secure DB connections with SSL/TLS
- IP whitelisting and firewall rules via UFW
- Password policies and account lockout mechanisms

**Next Steps:**
- **Backup & Recovery**: Expand on how backups are handled and documented.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Document your basic DR plan.
- **Polishing**: Add any final thoughts and contributions.
